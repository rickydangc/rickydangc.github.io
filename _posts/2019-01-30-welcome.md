I am Chong Dang and this is my first blog post! I am very excited to start blogging and to share with you insights about my favorite Data Science topics and involve you in a Data Scientist experience!

Currently, I am working as a Data Scientist in a Non-profit Organization, and I will start my Ph.D. studies in August, 2020 at College of Medicine - University of Florida.  It feels great and I enjoy this transition phase a lot. Closing one phase of life and opening a new chapter. I am excited how I will feel being a student again in an international and highly quality research class. But for now, I enjoy to welcome you at Ricky’s Data Science World to share with you first insights into self-empowerment, personal growth and how my Ph.D. studies will start off!
