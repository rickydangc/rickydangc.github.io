> Be a better man.

My name is Chong(翀) Dang (党), which means always keep moving forward in Chinese. 

My past 20+ years have been a long great journey. I always love trying new things and gaining new experiences.


##### Before 24 - My stories in China
I spent my teenage years at boarding schools where I became interested in math and computer science. Hard work paid off. I was ranked 1500 / 350,000+ in College Entrance Examination (Gaokao).

I went to college at Northwest University of China, one of the most prestigious universities, majoring in EE. There were so many opportunities and I've always been grateful for what I experienced there.


##### After 24 - My stories in USA
At the age of 24, I came to United States of America. At graduate school, I made a conscious to break out of my comfort zone and started digging into the field of Data Science and Computer Science. 

During the summer break, I participated in a lot of research opportunities, such as “Online Grading Systems”, “Real Estate Analysis New York Area”, “Recommendation Systems”and so on.
