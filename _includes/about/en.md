> Be a better man.

My name is Chong Dang, which means always keep moving forward in Chinese. I always love trying new things and gaining new experiences.


#### Before 24 - My stories in China
I spent my teenage years at boarding schools where I became interested in math and computer science. Hard work paid off. I was ranked 1500 / 350,000+ in College Entrance Examination (Gaokao).

I went to college at Northwest University of China, one of the most prestigious universities, majoring in EE. There were so many opportunities and I've always been grateful for what I experienced there.


#### After 24 - My stories in United States
At the age of 24, I came to United States of America and. At graduate school, I made a conscious to break out of my comfort zone and started digging into the field of Data Science and Computer Science. 

Now, I’m a professional Data Scientist as well as a Data Engineer. I love data and machine learning. Currently, I'm working at American Kennel Club. I'm also a research assistant at College of Medcine, University of Florida and OMSCS student at Georgia Institute of Technology. I’d like to use data science techniques to apply on healthcare data, then we can solve a lot of problems in healthcare, help people to improve their lives. For example, we can use HER data build models for individual disease risk prediction, recommending treatments, cluster a patient into group with common characteristics and find similar patients.
