#### Environment

If you have jekyll installed, simply run `jekyll serve` in Command Line
and preview the themes in your browser. You can use `jekyll serve --watch` to watch for changes in the source files as well.


#### Get Started

You can easily get started by modifying `_config.yml`:

```
# Site settings

SEOTitle: Hux Blog			# check out docs for more detail
description: "Cool Blog"    # ...

# SNS settings      
github_username: huxpro     # modify this account to yours
weibo_username: huxpro      # the footer woule be auto-updated.

# Build settings
# paginate: 10              # nums of posts in one page
```

There are more options you can check out in the [Jekyll - Official Site](http://jekyllrb.com/), or you can directly dive into code to find more.
